Pathogen clearance and resolution of inflammation in patients with pneumonia require an effective local T cell response. Nevertheless, local T cell activation may drive lung injury, particularly during prolonged episodes of respiratory failure characteristic of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. While T cell responses in the peripheral blood are well described, the evolution of T cell phenotypes and molecular signatures in the distal lung of patients with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens is understudied. Accordingly, we serially obtained 432 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 273 patients with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure, including 74 unvaccinated patients with COVID-19, and performed flow cytometry, transcriptional, and T cell receptor profiling on sorted CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets. In patients with COVID-19 but not pneumonia secondary to other pathogens, we found that early and persistent enrichment in CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets correlated with survival to hospital discharge. Activation of interferon signaling pathways early after intubation for COVID-19 was associated with favorable outcomes, while activation of NF-κB-driven programs late in disease was associated with poor outcomes. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia whose alveolar T cells preferentially targeted the Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins tended to experience more favorable outcomes than patients whose T cells predominantly targeted the ORF1ab polyprotein complex. In patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, alveolar T cell interferon responses targeting structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins characterize patients who recover, yet these responses progress to NF-κB activation against non-structural proteins in patients who go on to experience poor clinical outcomes.
